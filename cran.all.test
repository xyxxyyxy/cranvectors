experimental investigation of the aerodynamics of a
wing in a slipstream .
  an experimental study of a wing in a propeller slipstream was
made in order to determine the spanwise distribution of the lift
increase due to slipstream at different angles of attack of the wing
and at different free stream to slipstream velocity ratios .  the
results were intended in part as an evaluation basis for different
theoretical treatments of this problem .
  the comparative span loading curves, together with
supporting evidence, showed that a substantial part of the lift increment
produced by the slipstream was due to a /destalling/ or
boundary-layer-control effect .  the integrated remaining lift
increment, after subtracting this destalling lift, was found to agree
well with a potential flow theory .
  an empirical evaluation of the destalling effects was made for
the specific configuration of the experiment .

simple shear flow past a flat plate in an incompressible fluid of small
viscosity .
in the study of high-speed viscous flow past a two-dimensional body it
is usually necessary to consider a curved shock wave emitting from the
nose or leading edge of the body .  consequently, there exists an
inviscid rotational flow region between the shock wave and the boundary
layer .  such a situation arises, for instance, in the study of the
hypersonic viscous flow past a flat plate .  the situation is somewhat
different from prandtl's classical boundary-layer problem . in prandtl's
original problem the inviscid free stream outside the boundary layer is
irrotational while in a hypersonic boundary-layer problem the inviscid
free stream must be considered as rotational .  the possible effects of
vorticity have been recently discussed by ferri and libby .  in the
present paper, the simple shear flow past a flat plate in a fluid of small
viscosity is investigated .  it can be shown that this problem can again
be treated by the boundary-layer approximation, the only novel feature
being that the free stream has a constant vorticity .  the discussion
here is restricted to two-dimensional incompressible steady flow .

approximate solutions of the incompressible laminar
boundary layer equations for a plate in shear flow .
  the two-dimensional steady boundary-layer
problem for a flat plate in a
shear flow of incompressible fluid is considered .
solutions for the boundary-
layer thickness, skin friction, and the velocity
distribution in the boundary
layer are obtained by the karman-pohlhausen
technique .  comparison with
the boundary layer of a uniform flow has also
been made to show the effect of
vorticity .

one-dimensional transient heat flow in a multilayer

  in a recent contribution to the readers'
forum wassermann gave analytic
solutions for the temperature in a double
layer slab, with a triangular heat
rate input at one face, insulated at the other,
and with no thermal resistance
at the interface .  his solutions were for the
three particular cases..
i propose here to give the general solution
to this problem, to indicate
briefly how it is obtained using the method of
reference 2, and to point out
that the solutions given by wassermann are
incomplete for times longer
than the duration of the heat input .

the effect of controlled three-dimensional roughness
on boundary layer transition at supersonic speeds .
  experiments were performed in the 12-in. supersonic wind
tunnel of the jet propulsion laboratory of the california
institute of technology to investigate the effect of three-dimensional
roughness elements (spheres) on boundary-layer transition on a
tained at local mach numbers of 1.90, 2.71, and 3.67 by varying
trip size, position, spacing, and reynolds number per inch .
the results indicate that (1) transition from laminar to turbulent
flow induced by three-dimensional roughness elements begins
when the double row of spiral vortices trailing each element
contaminates and breaks down the surrounding field of vorticity, (2)
transition appears rather suddenly, becoming more violent with
increasing roughness height relative to the boundary-layer
thickness, (3) after the breakdown of the vorticity field, the strength
of the spiral vortices may still persist in the sublayer of the
ensuing turbulent flow, (4) lateral spacing of roughness elements has
little effect upon the initial breakdown (contamination) of the
laminar flow, and (5) the trip reynolds number where u
and v are the velocity and kinematic viscosity at the outer edge of
the boundary layer and k is roughness height, such that transition
occurs at the roughness position, varies as the position reynolds
number to the one-fourth power, viz., where x is
trip position .

measurements of the effect of two-dimensional and three-dimensional
roughness elements on boundary layer transition .
in his study of the effect of roughness on transition, h. l.
dryden found, on the basis of available data, that the effect
of a two-dimensional roughness element such as a /trip wire/
could be represented reasonably well in terms of a functional
relation between and, where is the reynolds number
of transition based on distance from the leading edge, is the
height of the roughness element, and is the boundary-layer
displacement thickness at the position of the element .  at his
suggestion some additional data were obtained, primarily to
extend the range to higher values of, during the course of an
investigation of transition on a flat plate conducted at the
national bureau of standards .  after the results on the two-
dimensional roughness elements were obtained, it appeared to be
desirable to see whether a row of three-dimensional roughness
elements would behave in the same way .
